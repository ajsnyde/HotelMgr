Things to do:
	Stop the program from resizing the images every time they change. It slows the program down too much.
	Figure out resources - have all files accessed within the jar as resources
	Add tooltips to everything
	Convert all SQL statements into prepared statements. Far easier and safer.
	Speed up SQL queries - use first and other modifiers to cut them short when possible
